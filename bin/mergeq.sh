#
# This starts a "merge" build on your CI server. Rather than allowing untested
# merges, we first run tests on the merge and then push the merge to the
# respective branch. It does this by making use of a queue branch (not
# a real term, don't bother googling it) which is basically a branch
# for which the HEAD and each HEAD^ is a "Queueing merge" commit whose
# HEAD^2 is the the actual merge we will be testing.
#
# For example, this is merge/integration:
#
# *   25bc0e2 - Queuing merge: feature/warning-when-inviting-group-members-not-in-org into integration (5 days ago) <Shaun Dern>
# |\
# | *   9a6ffe1 - Merge feature/warning-when-inviting-group-members-not-in-org into integration (5 days ago) <Shaun Dern>
# | |\
# | | * edee6e3 - set html of target node vs text in remote_form_msg (5 days ago) <Shaun Dern>
# | | * 14c44bd - Remove Warning: prefix to warning localeapp copy (6 days ago) <Shaun Dern>
# * | |   bc31325 - Queuing merge: feature/hide-activity-feed-from-anonymous-users into integration (6 days ago) <Cassie Schmitz>
# |\ \ \
# | * \ \   c3fce08 - Merge feature/hide-activity-feed-from-anonymous-users into integration (6 days ago) <Cassie Schmitz>
#
# In the above example, the build agent will:
#  * take 9a6ffe1 and attempt to merge that to integration
#  * run tests
#  * if the tests pass, it will push the merge.
#
# Pushing the merge is handled by the mergeq_ci executable.
#
# The script will have the user do the merge locally so that they can resolve
# any merge conflicts. The user must do script/mergeq --continue after resolving
# conflicts and committing the merge.
#
# If new merge conflicts appear on the agent due to another branch being
# merged in ahead of the one they are merging, the build will fail.
